    <h2>User Interviews</h2>

    <p>
      User Interviews are one of the best ways to gauge what people would want to see in any website, especially in portfolio websites. What you expect to see in a portfolio website may not be what others expect to see, so it helps in having more opinions. Furthermore, you may have forgotten an important aspect of your website that others can point out through a user interview. Questions that are helpful are those that ask what they would expect to see in a portfolio website, or what helps in expressing skills for the website. Another great question would be if the website portrays the owner’s personality well. The questions should strive to come closer to achieving the goals of the website.

    <h2>Competitor Analysis</h2>

    <p>
      A competitor analysis is when you do active research on competitors of your products. In this case, I did research on other portfolio websites that exhibits creativity and uniqueness that is worthy of being called a “great” website. I searched for other websites that are featured in top 10 websites to search for inspiration. I looked at their style and how they portray their personality through the website, or how they make it look professional. I also took note of what they use in html and css styling to get an idea of how to use these techniques for my website.

    <h2>Feature Value Matrix</h2>
    <div class="about-text">

    <p>
    The feature value matrix shows a list of features I want for the website that awards points based on high value in user, business, and technical effort. Which features need to be implemented are those that are high in user value, and low in technical effort. I added features such as: parallax scrolling, images, scrolling links, and a fixed nav bar as basic features for my website to maximize the user satisfaction of the website.

    <p>
      Feature Prioritization is the graphical representation of the feature value matrix. It shows which features are needed in an easy to see visual way. Each feature is shown in a graph that connects to each category. For prioritizing, the features that are high in the user value line, and low in technical effort is shown to be near the origin of the graph, and so we prioritize those features.

    <h2>User Stories</h2>

    <p>
    User Stories are a way to imagine what sort of users will use your website, and what types of behaviors they will display with your current iteration of the website. The Stories I made follows a basic demographic of recruiters, coworkers, friends and family. They each have a reason to go to my website, due to business or personal reasons. User stories are a way to make sure that these users can accomplish what they want to do using your website.

    <h2>Cognitive Walkthrough</h2>

    <p>
      Cognitive Walkthroughs are like user interviews, but more intensive and letting the user use the website. You can ask questions during the walkthrough that further explains why they did that behavior. I asked questions on why they clicked on that button to go to a section they wanted to go, so that I know exactly if my buttons and display are achieving my desired goal of getting them to go to that section. Each cognitive walkthrough had its fair share of uniqueness in that some users don’t know how to get to a section, while others know exactly where to go.

    <h2>User Testing</h2>

    <p>
  I chose the 5 second test and the click test for my usability testing. I chose them because they are the easiest and provides the most information for me. The 5 second test gives a view of the website for 5 seconds and I can ask a variety of questions after to the user. I asked what they focused on for the 5 seconds, which element stands out the most, what they think the webpage is about, and what they dislike about it. I chose the click test to gauge the user’s behavior in doing a task. It shows a heatmap of where the user clicks on the screen. The task I chose is where would you click to go find a portfolio. Some challenges were acquiring volunteers for the test, and creating suitable questions for the tests.

    <h2>Summary Of Findings</h2>
    <div class="about-text">
    <p>
      The research and user testing helped a great deal in showing me what works with my website, and what doesn’t. People kept mentioning how the title underneath my name is hard to see because it blends in with the background. The most common response was also that they chose to go the “about” section to check on a portfolio, but my portfolio was actually under the projects section. This means that I had a misconception of what users view a portfolio and should apply that later on as a fix.

</p>
<p>
The research helped in the design and overall layout of my website. I saw many websites upon my time researching and most had the same elements of readability, consistency, and minimalist color choices to keep their website clean and cohesive. They showed images of their projects as well. I took inspiration from this and chose to follow in their example and go for a minimalist style as well, but also give my take on the styling of the website.

    <h2>Incorporation Of Findings</h2>
    <div class="about-text">
    <p>
      I plan to fix a variety of things in my website for the future. For one, I plan to change the color of the text of the title to be more readable to the user. I also plan to change the image gallery into a carousel wheel and display more images in a fun manner. Furthermore, I plan to put a pdf of my resume under the about me section for my users looking for my resume.

  <p>
    Other fixes I want to do includes a hamburger menu showing the navbar to the side when clicked on, when it is on a mobile display. This was a suggestion made by my users.
    I also plan to fix the about me to give a more personal paragraph about myself, rather than lines of personal statements.
